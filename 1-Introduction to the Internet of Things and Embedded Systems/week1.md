# 1-Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device. Describe and list the features of the device.

Television: was a regular electronic device capable of receives electromagnetic signals  via satellites.

but now is capable of connecting to the internet  and watching many services on the internet at any time you would such as YouTube , Netflix etc.. also has smart sensors to recognize the surrounded environment in which it contains power-saving mode

also some IoT TV has smells emitting devices capable of emits smells according to scenes shown on TV such as sea smells
food smells etc..

# 2-Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

**A. Regular TV :**        
                    1- Revives data only
                    2- Not interaction with surrounded environment                    
                    3- has no smart sensors

**B. IoT TV :**            
                    1- Revives and transmits data
                    2- Interacts with surrounded environment
                    3- has smart sensors and smart modes  

# 3-For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non-IOT device. Describe any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device.

no improvements or limitations I have at this time

# 4-Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator.

**A- Regular TV**
 prices from 100$ to 400$
**B- IoT TV**
 prices from 700$ to 5000$

the concerns about the data which stored in the  manufacturing company server , since if the hackers reach to these info could figure out when I watch the TV and consequently  when I am sleeping or outside.
