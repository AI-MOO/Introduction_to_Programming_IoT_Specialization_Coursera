# Build a circuit that lights an LED when it is sufficiently dark in a room. Demonstrate the circuit by covering the photoresistor to simulate darkness.

Create a video (or a screencast) of your circuit in action.

If you have real hardware then demonstrate the real circuit. If you do not have real hardware then use the simulator.

Regardless of which method you use, provide a link to the location of your video or screencast on the Internet. Do not upload your video here. .
