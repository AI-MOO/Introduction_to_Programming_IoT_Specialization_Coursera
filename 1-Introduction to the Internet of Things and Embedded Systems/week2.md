# 1-Identify two embedded systems that are sold on the market today and analyze their interfaces.

1- A digital camera uses an electronic image sensor to create still photographs and record video. The optical system of a digital camera works like a film camera, in which a typical lens and diaphragm are used to adjust electronic image sensor lighting.

2- A microphone is a device that captures audio by converting sound waves into an electrical signal. This signal can be amplified as an analog signal or may be converted to a digital signal, which can be processed by a computer or other digital audio device.

# 2- Describe all inputs to each system and outputs from each system.

**A digital camera** may be considered both an input and output device (sometimes referred to as an I/O device) as it can both take pictures (input) and send them to your computer (output).

**Microphones only output signal:** Microphones transduce sound waves into electrical audio signals which are then outputted from the microphoneâ€™s output connection. A caveat here is that digital USB microphones have internal ADCs and so they output digital audio data rather than analog audio signals. Mics are the beginning of a signal flow line.

**Microphones are input devices:** Microphones send/input data into a computer system for processing. Of course, the microphone audio signals must first be converted to digital audio before being inputted into a computer.

# 3-Classify the inputs and outputs based on their mode of interaction:.

-Visual - describing data carried by visible light

-Audio - describing data carried by sound

-Tactile - describing data carried by touch

-Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals

**Camera (mode of interaction) :**

-Visual - describing data carried by visible light

-Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals

**Microphone:**

-Audio - describing data carried by sound

-Electronic - describing data encoded in electrical signals
